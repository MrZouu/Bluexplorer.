# Schematic
Description of the circuit schematic, created in Fusion360.

The custom PCB is designed to be mounted as a shield on the Raspberry Pi. 
It provides a more structured and reliable way to connect the main components, making assembly more convenient, although it remains optional.  

#### Components connected to the PCB:  
- **IMU Sensor** (Gyroscope)  
- **Mini 360 Input** (to power the Raspberry Pi)  
- **GPIO PWM Pins** (to control the ESC motors)  
- **TDS Sensor Pins** (Power and signal)  
- **Pressure Sensor Pins** (Power and signal)
- **MCP3008 ADC** (to read analog sensor data)

# 3D Design

The entire 3D design was created using **Shapr3D**. 
The focus was on making the structure **compact**, ensuring all components interlock securely.
The internal structure was designed to be easily **removed in one piece** from the main tube by simply taking off the sealing joint.

### Sealing System  
A **custom sealing system** is used to allow cables to pass through while maintaining **optimal waterproofing**. 
Wires go through the joint, and **resin is poured** to create a tight seal while still allowing electrical connections between the inside and outside.

# Getting Started
### How to set up the bluexplorer submarine

## 1. Install Raspberry Pi OS  
Use **Raspberry Pi Imager** to install an OS on the Raspberry Pi.  

- Download **[Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)**  
- Flash an image onto an SD card  
- Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi

---

## 2. Install Required Software  
Install the following software on your computer for communication and control:

- **[VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)**
- **[Termius](https://termius.com/)**
- **[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)**

---

## 3. Connect the Submarine via Ethernet
### **Check the Assigned IP**  
1. **Remove the SD card from the Raspberry Pi and insert it into your PC**  
2. **Open the `cmdline.txt` file** located in the `/boot/` partition  
3. Look for a parameter like:`ip=<configured_ip>`
   
If an IP is assigned, use it for the connection.
If no static IP is set, check the router‚Äôs DHCP list to find the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs address.

### Ethernet Setup on Windows  
1. **Connect the drone Ethernet cable to your PC**  
2. **Modify network settings**:  
   - Go to:  
     **Settings -> Network & Internet -> Ethernet -> Change adapter options**  
   - Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) -> Properties**  
   - Set:  
     ```
     IP Address: <set a compatible static IP>
     Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
     ```
3. **Verify connection**:  
- Open **Command Prompt** and run:  
  ```shell
  ping <Raspberry Pi IP>
  ```
- If the response is successful, the connection is established.
  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember to reset Ethernet settings to automatic after use to restore normal network usage.**  

---

## 4. Transfer Code to Raspberry Pi  
Download the necessary scripts:  
- [`bluecode.py`](https://github.com/MrZouu/Bluexplorer./blob/main/bluecode.py)  
- [`controller_data_transmitter.py`](https://github.com/MrZouu/Bluexplorer./blob/main/controller_data_transmitter.py)

To transfer `bluecode.py` to the Raspberry Pi, use **Termius** or another SSH client:  
```shell
scp bluecode.py pi@<Raspberry Pi IP>:/home/pi/
```
---

## 5. Enable VNC for Remote Access 
Download the necessary scripts:
1. Enable **VNC** on Raspberry Pi:
```shell
sudo raspi-config
```
Go to:  
     **Interface Options -> VNC -> Enable** 
Restart the Raspberry Pi:
```shell
sudo reboot
```
2. Connect using VNC Viewer:
    - Open VNC Viewer
    - Enter the Raspberry Pi IP address
    - Login with your credentials

---
      
## 6. Install Required Python Libraries
On the Raspberry Pi, install the necessary libraries:
```shell
  pip install opencv-python RPi.GPIO spidev ms5837 adafruit-circuitpython-lsm9ds1
```

---

## 7. Start the System
### Start the Submarine Code
Run `bluecode.py` on the Raspberry Pi:
```shell
  python3 bluecode.py
```
### Connect the Controller
  Pair the game controller via Bluetooth to yout PC
  Run the control script on your PC:
```shell
  python3 controller_data_transmitter.py
```
You should get video feedback as below, and the controls should activate the motors of the drone.
